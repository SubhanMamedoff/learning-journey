## üìÇ Problems Included

Each problem is contained in its own folder. Click the folder names to view the source code:

1. **[Sort](sort/answers.txt)** ‚Äì Implements sorting algorithms to reorder arrays of integers.  
2. **[Plurality](plurality/plurality.c)** ‚Äì Implements a simple voting system to determine the winner of an election.  
3. **[Runoff](runoff/runoff.c)** ‚Äì Implements a runoff election algorithm with multiple rounds of voting.  
4. **[Tideman](tideman/tideman.c)** ‚Äì Implements the Tideman (ranked pairs) voting algorithm.

## üõ†Ô∏è Concepts Practiced
- **Sorting algorithms** (e.g., selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort)  
- **Arrays and pointers**  
- **Functions and modular programming**  
- **Algorithmic problem solving**  
- **Input validation and data handling**

## üöÄ How to Compile and Run
Navigate to the folder of the problem you want to test and compile the program:

```
cd plurality
make plurality
./plurality
```

Replace `plurality` with `sort`, `runoff`, or `tideman` for the other problems.
