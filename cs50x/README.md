# CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science (Harvard)

This repository contains my solutions to **Harvard’s CS50x (Introduction to Computer Science)** problem sets and final project.  
The course is known for its rigorous curriculum and covers fundamental computer science concepts using C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📚 Course Topics
- C programming (memory, algorithms, data structures)  
- Python  
- SQL and databases  
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask)  
- Security, scalability, and software engineering principles  

## 📝 Problem Sets
- [Problem Set 1](./pset1) → C basics (loops, conditionals, greedy algorithms, Luhn’s Algorithm)  
- [Problem Set 2](./pset2) → Arrays, Caesar & Vigenère ciphers  
- [Problem Set 3](./pset3) → Algorithms, searching and sorting  
- [Problem Set 4](./pset4) → Memory, pointers, JPEG recovery  
- [Problem Set 5](./pset5) → Data structures (hash tables, linked lists, trie)  
- [Problem Set 6](./pset6) → Python (text analysis, sentiment analysis)  
- [Problem Set 7](./pset7) → SQL, database queries  
- [Problem Set 8](./pset8) → Web development (HTML, CSS, JS)  
- [Problem Set 9](./pset9) → Web development (Flask)  
- [Final Project](./final_project) → My own project applying course concepts  

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Strong foundation in C programming  
- Algorithmic thinking and problem-solving  
- Memory management and data structures  
- Building web applications with Python and Flask  
- Database design and querying with SQL  
- Full-stack fundamentals  

## 📜 Certificate
