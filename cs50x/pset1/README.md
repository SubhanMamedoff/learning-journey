# CS50x: Problem Set 1

This directory contains my solutions to **Problem Set 1** of Harvard's CS50x (Introduction to Computer Science) course.  
The problems in this set focus on **C programming fundamentals**, including conditionals, loops, functions, and user input.

## Problems

### 1. Hello
- **File:** `hello/hello.c`  
- **Description:**  
  A simple program that asks for the user’s name and then greets them with `"hello, <name>"`.  
- **Concepts:** Basic C syntax, standard input/output, strings.

### 2. Mario (More)
- **File:** `mario/more/mario.c`  
- **Description:**  
  Prints a full pyramid of hashes (`#`) of a user-specified height, mimicking the pyramid design in Nintendo’s *Super Mario Bros.*.  
- **Concepts:** Loops, nested loops, conditionals.

### 3. Cash
- **File:** `cash/cash.c`  
- **Description:**  
  Implements a greedy algorithm to calculate the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given amount in U.S. currency.  
- **Concepts:** Greedy algorithms, arithmetic, loops.

---

### 4. Credit
- **File:** `credit/credit.c`  
- **Description:**  
  Checks whether a credit card number is valid using **Luhn’s algorithm**, and determines the card type (AMEX, VISA, MasterCard).  
- **Concepts:** Loops, conditionals, algorithms, modular arithmetic.

## Key Concepts Learned
- Using the `cs50` library (`get_int`, `get_string`, etc.)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`) and conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`)  
- Problem-solving with algorithms  
- C programming style and debugging techniques
