sort1 uses: bubble sort
How do you know?: I tested random, reversed, and sorted files of size 10,000 using the time command. Bubble sort is very slow on reversed and random inputs. Based on the results, I concluded that sort1 is bubble sort.

sort2 uses: merge sort
How do you know?: I tested random, reversed, and sorted files of size 10,000 using the time command. It was very fast on all inputs and the times were almost the same. Therefore, I concluded that sort2 is merge sort.

sort3 uses: selection sort
How do you know?: I tested random, reversed, and sorted files of size 10,000 using the time command and compared it with the other sorts. After identifying the other two, I concluded that sort3 is selection sort.
